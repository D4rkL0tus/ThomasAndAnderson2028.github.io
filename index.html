            <h1><ul>>Goals and Actions</ul></h1>
            We as your future administration want to impose new standards
            on the laws of drinking, and we believe that the alcohol use age
            should be brought down to 18 years of age in all fifty states.
            
            We feel that if you can serve in our military and protect our country
            you damn sure should be able to get a drink when you are in our country!

            We also want to impose new laws on illegal immigration and the only people
            that can be allowed in this country are grey aliens from Mars, this is to impose
            a more indept approach to fixing our infrastrucutre to make sure 
            we can MAKE THE RES GREAT AGAIN!
